If all management tokens are lost, it is possible to reset the ACL bootstrap so that it can be performed again. 
First, you need to determine the reset index with the bootstrap endpoint:

nomad acl bootstrap
Error: Error bootstrapping: Unexpected response code: 500 (ACL bootstrap already done (reset index: 7))

echo 7 >> /nomad-data-dir/server/acl-bootstrap-reset

nomad acl bootstrap  # this works now and generate bootstrap token
