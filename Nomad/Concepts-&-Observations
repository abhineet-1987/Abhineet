Nomad is not secure-by-default. Like all security considerations, one must appropriately determine what concerns they have for their environment and adapt to these security recommendations accordingly.

For ACLs, all Nomad servers in the cluster must be restarted with acl { enabled = true }. If even one server is running with ACLs disabled, bootstrapping will fail with below error.
"Error bootstrapping: Unexpected response code: 400 (ACL support disabled)"
