Method of metric collection:-
  Push : In the push method, your applications or microservices will send the metrics to the time series database
        via an endpoint that is provided by the time series database (eg graphite) and via protocols such as TCP, UDP, or HTTP.
  Scrape : So your application or microservices must provide some API for the time series database to read the metrics. 
        Example of a scrape method is when Prometheus scrapes the metrics from your, say, Python or dotnet or Java application.

Types of telemetry data:-
MELT
Metrics : So a metric is an aggregated value representing events in a period of time.
Events : action happenning at a given time
Logs :  very detailed representation of an event
Trace : Shows interactionof microservices to fulfill a request

### Install Prometheus on Mac-OS:
brew install prometheus
Go to path /opt/homebrew/etc
brew services start prometheus
On web browser open http://localhost:9090


What is consul_exporter as given in https://prometheus.io/download/ website?
consul_exporter is a service that scrapes Consul’s HTTP API and exposes Consul metrics at /metrics so Prometheus can scrape them.
It acts as a bridge between:
Consul (source of data)
Prometheus (metrics storage & alerting)

#### Install Prometheus on Ubuntu 
sudo su
Go to https://prometheus.io/download/
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.5.0/prometheus-3.5.0.linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar xvf prometheus-3.5.0.linux-arm64.tar.gz
nohup ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml &
On web browser open http://<ip-of-multipass-vm>:9090

##### Data Collection 
Source system emitting metrics --------> Exporter (customized as per source) --------> Prometheus

Exporters collect metrics from applications or systems and expose them in Prometheus format.
Prometheus scrapes these exporters to store metrics and trigger alerts.
Exporters translate system- or service-specific metrics into Prometheus format (e.g., SQL query stats, Consul health, HAProxy traffic).
Examples: mysqld_exporter / postgres_exporter for SQL databases, consul_exporter for Consul catalog & health, cloudwatch_exporter for AWS CloudWatch metrics, and haproxy_exporter for HAProxy requests, errors, and latency.

####### Node exporter:
Node exporter is an official Prometheus exporter for collecting metrics that are exposed by Unix based kernels, for example Ubuntu and Linux servers. So some of the metrics that we can collect using node exporter include, but obviously not limited to
CPU usage, disk usage, memory and network IO.

On ubuntu multipass VM:-
Go to https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.10.2/node_exporter-1.10.2.linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar xvf node_exporter-1.10.2.linux-arm64.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-1.10.2.linux-arm64
./node_exporter
hostname -I # to get the ip of multipass VM
On your browser open http://192.168.64.5:9100 to view the node metrics
