Method of metric collection:-
  Push : In the push method, your applications or microservices will send the metrics to the time series database
        via an endpoint that is provided by the time series database (eg graphite) and via protocols such as TCP, UDP, or HTTP.
  Scrape : So your application or microservices must provide some API for the time series database to read the metrics. 
        Example of a scrape method is when Prometheus scrapes the metrics from your, say, Python or dotnet or Java application.

Types of telemetry data:-
MELT
Metrics : So a metric is an aggregated value representing events in a period of time.
Events : action happenning at a given time
Logs :  very detailed representation of an event
Trace : Shows interactionof microservices to fulfill a request

What is consul_exporter as given in https://prometheus.io/download/ website?
consul_exporter is a service that scrapes Consul’s HTTP API and exposes Consul metrics at /metrics so Prometheus can scrape them.
It acts as a bridge between:
Consul (source of data)
Prometheus (metrics storage & alerting)
