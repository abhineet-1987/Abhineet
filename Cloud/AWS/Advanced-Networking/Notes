This Network ACL (Access Control List) configuration defines inbound traffic rules for a subnet in your VPC. Here's what each part means and how it behaves:

🔐 Rule Breakdown
Rule Number	Type	Protocol	Port Range	Source	Action
100	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
* (default)	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Deny
🧠 What This Means
Rule 100: Allows all inbound traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) across all protocols and ports.
Rule * (default): Denies all inbound traffic that doesn't match any of the numbered rules.

🧭 How Network ACLs Work
Rules are evaluated in order by rule number, starting from the lowest.
Once a match is found, no further rules are evaluated.
The * rule is the implicit default rule that applies if no other rule matches.

✅ Final Behavior
Because Rule 100 allows all traffic and is evaluated before the default deny rule:

All inbound traffic is allowed into the subnet.
This setup is very permissive and should be used cautiously. If you're looking to restrict access, you'd typically define more granular rules (e.g., allow HTTP/HTTPS only) and rely on the default deny to block everything else.

For EC2 instance to be accessible from the Internet, below 2 criteria required:-
1. It should be in the public subnet
2. It should have public ip assigned to it
