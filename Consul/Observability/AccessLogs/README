Used multipass VM.
Created only single Consul server on VM and tested this.

Tested on Consul v1.20.13+ent

hostname -I     # To get ip of VM, you can use this ip in your browser along with reelevant app ports to access the application on your local web browser

# Install python and flask on Ubuntu for apps setup
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
python3 -m venv flask-env
source flask-env/bin/activate
pip install flask
pip install requests

# install sqlite on Ubuntu
apt install sqlite3

# install envoy on Ubuntu
wget -O- https://apt.envoyproxy.io/signing.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/envoy-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/envoy-keyring.gpg] https://apt.envoyproxy.io bookworm main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/envoy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install envoy
envoy --version


# Run the clickme app
nohup python3 clickme.py > clickme.log 2>&1 &
# Run sqlite db
nohup python3 db.py > db.log 2>&1 &

# Create configuration entry for proxy default
consul config write proxy-default.hcl

# Register clickme web service and db service in Consul
consul services register  web-service.hcl
consul services register  db-service.hcl

# Start sidecar envoy proxy for clickme web app and db app
nohup consul connect envoy -sidecar-for client1 > web-sidecar.log 2>&1 &
nohup consul connect envoy -sidecar-for client2 -admin-bind=192.168.64.12:19000 > db-sidecar.log 2>&1 &

Note: Since more than one envoy running on same machine, I have used -admin-bind=192.168.64.12:19000 for the second sidecar envoy proxy, 
else it will error out giving message that port 19000 on localhost i.e 127.0.0.1 is already in use.

You can access the clickme app on http://192.168.64.12:5002/    (where 192.168.64.12 is ip of VM)
You can access Consul UI on http://192.168.64.12:8500
