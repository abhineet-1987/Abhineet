# Important Points:-
consul-webhook-cert-manager exists solely to generate and rotate TLS certificates used by the consul-connect-injector webhook server.
The certificates generated by consul-webhook-cert-manager are used only for TLS between:
Kubernetes API Server ⇄ consul-connect-injector webhook server

The Consul Connect Injector functions as both a Mutating and a Validating admission webhook

consul-k8s-auth-method:
   Type:         kubernetes
   Description:  Kubernetes Auth Method
consul-k8s-component-auth-method:
   Type:         kubernetes
   Description:  Kubernetes Auth Method
Note: Both the above auth methods use service account consul-auth-method.
consul-k8s-component-auth-method is used by Consul control-plane components (connect-injector, controllers, gateways) to authenticate to Consul and obtain component-level ACL tokens with broader, operational permissions.
consul-k8s-auth-method is used by application workloads (consul-dataplane / Envoy sidecars) to authenticate to Consul and obtain service-scoped ACL tokens bound to individual Consul services.
