# Here’s the full tcpdump command that captures verbose UDP traffic on port 8301 for a specific host IP and saves it to a .pcap file:
sudo tcpdump -vvv -X -n udp port 8301 and host 172.31.30.205 -w serf_8301_capture.pcap

# For all traffic
sudo tcpdump -vvv -X -n host <HOST_IP> -w all_traffic_capture.pcap

# For tcp traffic 
sudo tcpdump -vvv -X -n tcp and host <HOST_IP> -w tcp_traffic_capture.pcap
