verify_incoming - If set to true, Consul requires that all incoming connections make use of TLS and that the client provides a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority from the ca_file or ca_path. 
By default, this is false, and Consul will not enforce the use of TLS or verify a client's authenticity.

verify_incoming=true
You can connect to me only if:
1. You use TLS
2. You present a certificate and that certificate is signed by my trusted CA”

verify_outgoing - If set to true, Consul requires that all outgoing connections from this agent make use of TLS and that the server provides a certificate that is signed by a Certificate Authority from the ca_file or ca_path. 
By default, this is false, and Consul will not make use of TLS for outgoing connections

verify_outgoing=true
I will only connect if:
1. TLS is used
2. The destination/target server presents a cert and that cert is signed by my trusted CA”

verify_server_hostname - When set to true, Consul verifies the TLS certificate presented by the servers match the hostname server.<datacenter>.<domain>. 
By default this is false, and Consul does not verify the hostname of the certificate, only that it is signed by a trusted CA.

Important:- verify_server_hostname applies to outgoing connections, not incoming ones.


################ mTLS ############
Minimum config to setup mTLS :-
verify_incoming = true
verify_outgoing = true

Best practice (strongest security):-
verify_incoming = true
verify_outgoing = true
verify_server_hostname = true
