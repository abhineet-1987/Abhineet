Enable control plane traffic between cluster peers with Mesh Gateways.
Set the PeerThroughMeshGateways parameter to true to route peering control plane traffic through mesh gateways.
Connect proxy configuration Modes are not applicable to peering control plane traffic. 
The flow of control plane traffic through the gateway is implied by the presence of a Mesh config entry with PeerThroughMeshGateways = true.

Kind = "mesh"
Peering {
   PeerThroughMeshGateways = true
}

By setting this mesh config on a cluster before creating a peering token, inbound control plane traffic will be sent through the mesh gateway registered this cluster, also known the accepting cluster. 
As mesh gateway instances are registered at the accepting cluster, their addresses will be exposed to the dialing cluster over the bi-directional peering stream.
Setting this mesh config on a cluster before establishing a connection will cause the outbound control plane traffic to flow through the mesh gateway.
To route all peering control plane traffic though mesh gateways, both the accepting and dialing cluster must have the mesh config entry applied.
