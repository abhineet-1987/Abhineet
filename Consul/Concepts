Now regarding min_quorum, it looks like that configuration wasnâ€™t named properly.
Ideally it should have been named something like min_servers as it is just an AutoPilot config that instructs when to stop pruning servers.

Gossip encrption ket at data directory -> cat /opt/consul/serf/local.keyring
consul join 172.31.8.233 (this can be executed from any of consul client or consul server). In consul config file use retry_join

By default value of MinQuorum = 0 in "consul operator autopilot get-config", you have to manually set it to some other value.
retry_join = ["172.31.8.233","172.31.3.96","172.31.13.251","172.31.12.100"]
