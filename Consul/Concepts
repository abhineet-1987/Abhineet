Now regarding min_quorum, it looks like that configuration wasn’t named properly.
Ideally it should have been named something like min_servers as it is just an AutoPilot config that instructs when to stop pruning servers.

Gossip encrption ket at data directory -> cat /opt/consul/serf/local.keyring
consul join 172.31.8.233 (this can be executed from any of consul client or consul server). In consul config file use retry_join

By default value of MinQuorum = 0 in "consul operator autopilot get-config", you have to manually set it to some other value.
retry_join = ["172.31.8.233","172.31.3.96","172.31.13.251","172.31.12.100"]

The Consul API Gateway backends should be part of service-mesh (connect-injected pods) and cannot make use of catalog-synced instances. 
Consul catalog-sync can only be used for service-discovery use-cases. Enabling both Service Mesh and Service Sync on the same Kubernetes services is not supported, as Service Mesh also registers Kubernetes service instances to Consul. 
Ensure that Service Sync is only enabled for namespaces and services that are not injected with the Consul sidecar for Service Mesh as described in Sync Enable/Disable.
