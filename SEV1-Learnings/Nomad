Error: port not up
Fix: Stale IPtables rules, The issue seems to have happened after Node heartbeat miss alerts from nomad client to nomad server. We have identified a potential bug with Nomad not removing stale iptable rules when static ports have been assigned to job and  when nomad client loses connectivity with nomad server.
Checked the health of API gateways and upstreams, both appeared healthy.
Since this is a repeated incident, we discovered a stale API gateway IP address and port entry which was unreachable via curl on port 8443.
We identified the node that duplicate API gateway IP table entry
We cleaned up the IPtables rules containing stale IP address entries:
Listed IPtables rules for port 8443 : iptables -L -t nat -n -v  | grep 8443
Took note of target in offending rules , identified the bad IP address, cleaned its references by deleting the each such rule from all Chains: iptables -t nat -D <chain-name> <rule-num>
Flushed the offending IPtables CHAIN relevant to target captured: iptables -t nat -F <chain-name>
Deleted the Iptables CHAIN as well: iptables -t nat -X <chain-name>
Later verified that all the offending iptables rules containing stale IP address dont exist anymore using : iptables -L -t nat -n -v  | grep 8443

Error: Closer look at the failing jobs logs revealed that Nomad is not able to pull a configured Envoy image. The private registry returns 404 "not found"
Fix: It was established that the private registry was reconfigured recently, so now it requires authentication. Unauthenticated requests get rejected.
No abnormalities in Nomad or Consul behaviour were noticed.
The customer team decided to proceed with manual distribution of the target image and reconfiguring jobs to use it locally instead of pulling it from the registry.
