Error: port not up
Fix: Stale IPtables rules, The issue seems to have happened after Node heartbeat miss alerts from nomad client to nomad server. We have identified a potential bug with Nomad not removing stale iptable rules when static ports have been assigned to job and  when nomad client loses connectivity with nomad server.
Checked the health of API gateways and upstreams, both appeared healthy.
Since this is a repeated incident, we discovered a stale API gateway IP address and port entry which was unreachable via curl on port 8443.
We identified the node that duplicate API gateway IP table entry
We cleaned up the IPtables rules containing stale IP address entries:
Listed IPtables rules for port 8443 : iptables -L -t nat -n -v  | grep 8443
Took note of target in offending rules , identified the bad IP address, cleaned its references by deleting the each such rule from all Chains: iptables -t nat -D <chain-name> <rule-num>
Flushed the offending IPtables CHAIN relevant to target captured: iptables -t nat -F <chain-name>
Deleted the Iptables CHAIN as well: iptables -t nat -X <chain-name>
Later verified that all the offending iptables rules containing stale IP address dont exist anymore using : iptables -L -t nat -n -v  | grep 8443
