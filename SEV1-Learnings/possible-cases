Whenever the cluster is broken, i.e leadership is lost or any node not being member of cluster (consul/nomad), check for :-

cpu
memory
disk utilization
iops
check connectivity between nodes
changes in firewall/routing rules, If in AWS check for security group inbound and outbound rules
check for how nodes are provisioned for eg through ASG in AWS etc
check required open ports
