###### Some useful networking commands ###############
ip addr   : Lists all network interfaces and their assigned IP addresses on the host.
ip route   : Displays the routing table, showing how the host directs traffic to different networks.
docker network ls   : Shows all Docker networks currently defined on the system.
docker network inspect <kind-network-name>   : Provides detailed configuration and connected containers for a specific Docker network (like the one KIND uses).

iptables,iptable rules, chain, NAT    ### Need to read more on this

###### How to clean up the IPtables rules containing stale IP address entries #########
Listed IPtables rules for port 8443 : iptables -L -t nat -n -v  | grep 8443
Took note of target in offending rules , identified the bad IP address, cleaned its references by deleting the each such rule from all Chains: iptables -t nat -D <chain-name> <rule-num>
Flushed the offending IPtables CHAIN relevant to target captured: iptables -t nat -F <chain-name>
Deleted the Iptables CHAIN as well: iptables -t nat -X <chain-name>
Later verified that all the offending iptables rules containing stale IP address dont exist anymore using : iptables -L -t nat -n -v  | grep 8443

To check OS details Linux:
cat /etc/os-release

netstat -antp # The command netstat -antp is used to display active network connections and listening ports
